# Beginning your SQL journey

`SQL`, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a language for interacting with data stored in something called a relational database.

You can think of a `relational database` as __a collection of tables.__
## `Table`
 A table is just a set of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet, which represents exactly one type of entity. For example, a table might represent employees in a company or purchases made, but not both.

Each row, or record, of a table contains information about a single entity. `For example`, in a table representing employees, each row represents a single person. Each column, or field, of a table contains a single attribute for all rows in the table. For example, in a table representing employees, we might have a column containing first and last names for all employees.

The table of employees might look something like this:




| id | name     | age     | nationality |
| ---| -------- | ------  | ----------- |
| 1  | Jessica  | 22      | Ireland     |
| 2  | Gabriel  | 48      | France      |
| 3  | Laurael  | 36      | US          |
