# Exercise 1

## Simple filtering of numeric values

As you learned in the previous exercise, the `WHERE` clause can also be used to filter numeric records, such as years or ages.

`For example` the following query selects all details for films with a budget over ten thousand dollars:

```
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE budget > 10000;
```
Now it's your turn to use the `WHERE` clause to filter numeric values!

`Questions:`
1. Get all details for all films released in 2016.
2. Get the number of films released before 2000.
3. Get the title and release year of films released after 2000.
