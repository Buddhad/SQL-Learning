## Learning to `COUNT`

What if you want to count the number of employees in your employees table? The `COUNT()` function lets you do this by returning the number of rows in one or more columns.

For example, this code gives the number of rows in the people table:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people;
```
